                                    Synopsis
                                    ````````

This is a vim plugin for adjusting colors depending on the time of the
day. Inspired by the similar plugin for emacs called 'theme-changer'.

                                  Why do this?
                                  ````````````

Apart from comprising ones favourite colours in a favourable
combination, colour themes are what their eyes be subject to throughout
the day and night. While these colours remain unchanged all the day,
however, ones surroundings do not: sun sets and rises, turning day into
night and night into day; and lights get turned on and off. The amount
and quality of light around one determines the intensity of colours
their eyes can tolerate. While brighter, lighter colours are easier ones
eyes during daylight, they start to gnaw them in the night. Dark colors
are suitable for use in the dark or under artificial illumination, but
are tiring during the day.

While it is very useful to switch colour themes based on the amount and
quality of illumination, most people either cannot be bothered to do so,
or forget to do it altogether. This vim plugin is my go at automating
this task, so that it is done for the vim user without they interfering,
and it is done at the first place.
